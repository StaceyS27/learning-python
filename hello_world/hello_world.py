# Errors
    # two common types of errors occur while writing python: SyntaxError and NameError
    # 1. SyntaxError - something is wrong with usage of language 
        # use of punctuation, paranthesis, command etc
    # 2. NameError - occurs when python interpreter does not recognize a word 
        # a variable that is never defined will throw this error 

#_______________________________________________________________________________________
# Numbers
    # python has a few numberic data types 
        # 1. integer - (int) is a whole number ex: 1,2,3 also -1,-2,-2 and 0
        # 2. floating-point number - (float) is a decimal

# Define the release and runtime integer variables below:
release_year = 1
runtime = 10

# Define the rating_out_of_10 float variable below: 
rating_out_of_10 = 2.5
print(rating_out_of_10)
